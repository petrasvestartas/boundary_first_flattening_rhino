# boundary_first_flattening_rhino

## Rhino MAC

Development of a MacOS-compatible Boundary First Flattening (“BFF”) component for Grasshopper 3D (which is to run in Rhino 7).

MacOS-compatible version of the BFF component for Grasshopper 3D (running in Rhino 7). BFF is a low-distortion conformal parameterization technique which is described in more detail in ACM Transactions on Graphics, Volume 37, Issue 1, Article No: 5, pp 1–14 and geometrycollective.github.io/boundary-first-flattening.


Its Windows-equivalent includes the following inputs:

* Mesh
* Folder Path for troubleshooting
* Map to Sphere boolean

and the following outputs:

* 3D of Mesh
* 2D of Mesh (BFF)

The MacOS-compatible version should have the same inputs, outputs and functionality as NGon BFF windows version. The component should  successfully on MacOS in Rhino 7 and is built as a C# component.
