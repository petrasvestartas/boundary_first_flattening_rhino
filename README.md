# ü¶è BOUNDARY FIRST FLATTENING FOR RHINO ü¶è

## Installation

* Download the full repostitory by cloning the github repo or downloading the zip file (click the top right green button).
* Go to the "build" folder: https://github.com/petrasvestartas/boundary_first_flattening_rhino/tree/main/build/BoundaryFirstFlattenning
* Copy the "BoundaryFirstFlattenning" folder to the Grasshopper libraries folder
* incase the files are blocked, unblock them by right click and properties (the usual Grasshopper library installation method)
* special case for MAC:
  * STEP1: git clone the current repo using terminal: git clone https://github.com/petrasvestartas/boundary_first_flattening_rhino.git

  * STEP2: copy paste the contents of the build folder into the grasshopper libraries folder (in this case the mac version)

  * STEP3: open terminal and go to "BFF" directory: type "cd" and drag and drop folder "BFF".

  * STEP4: run this command in the terminal: "chmod -R 777 MacOS"

## Testing

This is a cross platform version that works both on windows and mac os.

Grasshopper examples files are located in "test" folder.

## RHINO MAC

Development of a MacOS-compatible Boundary First Flattening (‚ÄúBFF‚Äù) component for Grasshopper 3D (which is to run in Rhino 7).

MacOS-compatible version of the BFF component for Grasshopper 3D (running in Rhino 7). BFF is a low-distortion conformal parameterization technique which is described in more detail in ACM Transactions on Graphics, Volume 37, Issue 1, Article No: 5, pp 1‚Äì14 and https://github.com/GeometryCollective/boundary-first-flattening .



**INPUT**
* Mesh: Valid triangulated Mesh
* Type: Integer 0 - flatten, 1 - map to sphere (for closed meshes only, without holes meaning now donuts), 2 - map to disk (for open meshes only)
* Number of cones: by default the input is 0, so the algorithm decides how many points are needed, otherwise the user can decided how many cones must be placed.
* UV - the flat geometry is mapped to unit domain
* Vertex Order - by default the flatenned mesh has a different vertex order than the 3d mesh that would work just fine for curve remapping. If you need to keep the 

**OUTPUT**
* 3D of Mesh
* 2D of Mesh (BFF)

The MacOS-compatible version should have the same inputs, outputs and functionality as NGon BFF windows version. The component should  successfully on MacOS in Rhino 7 and is built as a C# component.
