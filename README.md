# ü¶è BOUNDARY FIRST FLATTENING FOR RHINO ü¶è

## Installation

* Download the full repostitory by cloning the github repo or downloading the zip file (click the top right green button).
* Go to the "build" folder: https://github.com/petrasvestartas/boundary_first_flattening_rhino/tree/main/build/BoundaryFirstFlattenning
* Copy the "BoundaryFirstFlattenning" folder to the Grasshopper libraries folder
* incase the files are blocked, unblock them by right click and properties (the usual Grasshopper library installation method)

## Testing

Grasshopper examples files are located in "test" folder.

## RHINO MAC

Development of a MacOS-compatible Boundary First Flattening (‚ÄúBFF‚Äù) component for Grasshopper 3D (which is to run in Rhino 7).

MacOS-compatible version of the BFF component for Grasshopper 3D (running in Rhino 7). BFF is a low-distortion conformal parameterization technique which is described in more detail in ACM Transactions on Graphics, Volume 37, Issue 1, Article No: 5, pp 1‚Äì14 and https://github.com/GeometryCollective/boundary-first-flattening .



**INPUT**
* Mesh
* Folder Path for troubleshooting
* Map to Sphere boolean

and the following outputs:

**OUTPUT**
* 3D of Mesh
* 2D of Mesh (BFF)

The MacOS-compatible version should have the same inputs, outputs and functionality as NGon BFF windows version. The component should  successfully on MacOS in Rhino 7 and is built as a C# component.
